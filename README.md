# Precise Periodic Real Time Threads
Simulate a system where temperature and pressure are continuously monitored and periodically displayed. 
Each aspect of the system runs in its own thread, with controlled access to shared resources using mutexes to ensure thread safety. 
This code also assigns priorities to the threads to manage their execution order and responsiveness.
